\usage{
stat_fit_deviations(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  geom = "segment",
  method = "lm",
  formula = NULL,
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. Only needs
to be set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{method}{character Currently only "lm" is implemented.}

\item{formula}{a "formula" object. Using aesthetic names instead of
original variable names.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{na.rm}{a logical indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and should not inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\description{
\code{stat_fit_deviations} fits a linear model and returns fitted values and
residuals ready to be plotted as segments.
}
\details{
This stat can be used to automatically highlight residuals as
  segments in a plot of a fitted model equation. At the moment it supports
  only linear models fitted with function \code{lm()}. This stat only
  generates the residuals, the predicted values need to be separately added
  to the plot, so to make sure that the same model formula is used in all
  steps it is best to save the formula as an object and supply this object as
  argument to the different statistics.

  A ggplot statistic receives as data a data frame that is not the one passed
  as argument by the user, but instead a data frame with the variables mapped
  to aesthetics. In other words, it respects the grammar of graphics and
  consequently within the model \code{formula} names of
  aesthetics like $x$ and $y$ should be used intead of the original variable
  names, while data is automatically passed the data frame. This helps ensure
  that the model is fitted to the same data as plotted in other layers.
}
\note{
For linear models \code{x1} is equal to \code{x2}.
}
\section{Computed variables}{
 Data frame with same \code{nrow} as \code{data}
  as subset for each group containing five numeric variables. \describe{
  \item{x}{x coordinates of observations} \item{y.fitted}{x coordinates of
  fitted values} \item{y}{y coordinates of observations} \item{y.fitted}{y
  coordinates of fitted values}}

  To explore the values returned by this statistic we suggest the use of
  \code{\link[gginnards]{geom_debug}}. An example is shown below, where one
  can also see in addition to the computed values the default mapping of the
  fitted values to aesthetics \code{xend} and \code{yend}.

\examples{
library(gginnards) # needed for geom_debug()
# generate artificial data
set.seed(4321)
x <- 1:100
y <- (x + x^2 + x^3) + rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = mean(x^3) / 4)
my.data <- data.frame(x, y, group = c("A", "B"), y2 = y * c(0.5,2))

# give a name to a formula
my.formula <- y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE)

# plot
ggplot(my.data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = my.formula) +
  stat_fit_deviations(formula = my.formula, colour = "red") +
  geom_point()

# plot, using geom_debug()
ggplot(my.data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = my.formula) +
  stat_fit_deviations(formula = my.formula, colour = "red",
  geom = "debug") +
  geom_point()
