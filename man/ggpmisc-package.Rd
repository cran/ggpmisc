\title{ggpmisc: Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2'}
\description{
Extensions to 'ggplot2' respecting the grammar of graphics
    paradigm. Statistics: locate and tag peaks and valleys; label plot with the
    equation of a polynomial fitted with lm() or other types of models; labels
    with P-value, R^2 or adjusted R^2 or information criteria for fitted models;
    label with ANOVA table for fitted models; label with summary for fitted
    models. Model fit classes for which suitable methods are provided by package
    'broom' and 'broom.mixed' are supported. Scales and stats to build volcano
    and quadrant plots based on outcomes, fold changes, p-values and false 
    discovery rates.
}
\details{
The new facilities for cleanly defining new stats and geoms added to
'ggplot2' in version 2.0.0 and the support for nested tibbles and new syntax
for mapping computed values to aesthetics added to
'ggplot2' in version 3.0.0 are used in this package's code. This
means that 'ggpmisc' (>= 0.3.0) requires version 3.0.0 or later of ggplot2
while 'ggpmisc' (< 0.3.0) requires version 2.0.0 or later of ggplot2.

Extensions provided:
\itemize{
\item Function for conversion of time series data into tibbles that can be
plotted with ggplot.
\item \code{ggplot()} method for time series data.
\item Stats for locating and tagging "peaks" and "valleys" (local or global
 maxima and minima).
\item Stat for generating labels from a \code{lm()} model fit, including
formatted equation. By default labels are expressions but tikz device is
supported optionally with LaTeX formatted labels.
\item Stats for extracting information from a any model fit supported by
package 'broom'.
\item Stats for filtering-out/filtering-in observations in regions of a
panel or group where the density of observations is high.
\item Geom for annotating plots with tables.
}

The stats for peaks and valleys are coded so as to work correctly both with
numeric and POSIXct variables mapped to the x aesthetic. Special handling was
needed as text labels are generated from the data.
}
\note{
The signatures of \code{stat_peaks()} and \code{stat_valleys()} are
  identical to those of \code{stat_peaks} and \code{stat_valleys} from
  package \code{photobiology} but the variables returned are a subset as
  values related to light spectra are missing. Furthermore the stats from
  package \code{ggpmisc} work correctly when the x aesthetic uses a date or
  datetime scale, while those from package \code{photobiology} do not
  generate correct labels in this case.

\section{Warning!}{
 \code{geom_null()}, \code{stat_debug_group()},
  \code{stat_debug_panel()}, \code{geom_debug()}, \code{append_layers()},
  \code{bottom_layer()}, \code{delete_layers()}, \code{extract_layers()},
  \code{move_layers()}, \code{num_layesr()}, \code{shift_layers()},
  \code{top_layer()} and \code{which_layers()} have been moved from package
  'ggpmisc' into their own seperate package
  '\code{\link[gginnards]{gginnards-package}}.

 We thank Kamil Slowikowski not only for
  contributing ideas and code examples to this package but also for adding
  new features to his package 'ggrepel' that allow new use cases for
  \code{stat_dens2d_labels} from this package.
